## Summary

Veil (and any other Countermeasures that are developed as part of this thesis) is a multifaceted *art-with-a-capital-A* project. Surveillance, voyeurism, agency, complacence/compliance, identity, self, performance, legibility,  behavioural surplus extraction, capitalism/neoliberalism/fascism, the duality of technology, etc collide in a volatile, confusing thing(s). Below is a short list of sources that provide inspiration, erudition, guidance and philosophical underpinnings for the work. Since surveillance and counter-surveillance – state and corporate – is a dance/ping-pong game, this document will continue to change and evolve. 

## Platform / State Surveillance

**Shoshana Zuboff — *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism***  
 AoSC was the inspiration for this project. She has a long history of academic interrogation of the impact of technology on humanity/society. I wish I had read her earlier work *In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power* (1989) when I was just starting my career\! Fortunately I was able to read AoSC while at Google and it inspired me to leave the advertising side of the business. The primary influence of AoSC on Veil is this concept of identity as a surplus ‘natural’ resource. A resource which tech companies have extracted, refined and packaged to generate enormous wealth, powerful platforms AND vertiginous discord.  Chapters 1, 3, 8

### 	**Further reading: Julie Cohen – Between Truth and Power**

Provides detailed breakdown of the legal and economic functionings  of platform capitalism… and how industrial production-based legal/governmental systems which have largely failed to regulate/address them may change their course. Chapter 2, 4, 6 

**Mark Andrejevic — *Automated Media***  
Interrogate mass automation via current and speculative examples with a focus on academic and philosophical (Foucault, etc) interpretations. Relevant for frame due to the concept of “framelessness” or creating a hyper-aware, duplicated digital reality. Chapters 2.2, 2.4, 4, 6.3+, 7

**Frank Pasquale — *The Black Box Society***  
This work focuses on the vexxing core of surveillance: the desire for it to see everything while not being seen. Whether state or capitalism, surveillance thrives in darkness. This helps frame the Veil as a response to enforced legibility (ie recognition) rather than a critique of secrecy. Chapters 1, 2, 4

## Masks

**Adan C. McGee — *Surveillance Countermeasures: The Professional's Guide to Countering Hostile Surveillance Threats***  
Collects and updates two seminal tracts on surveillance and countersurveillance: Defeating Hostile Surveillance (2008) and Surveillance Countermeasures (1994). This entire book serves as inspiration for the countermeasures project. Of particular interest for Veil is Appendix 1 wherein the discussion focuses on strengths and weaknesses of technical surveillance (and anti-surveillance).

## Masks

**Hans Belting — *Face and Mask: A Double History***  
Belting believes that the face is a mask (aligns with Goffman’s belief that identity is a theatrical performance). This book explores the face’s history of representation, ritual, and substitution, treating it as something that has always been mediated. His work resists the idea that the face is a stable or purely personal object. For Veil, this history makes it possible to think of facial substitution as continuity rather than rupture AND begs the existential question is Veil the mask or is the original face the real veil? Deep\! Chapters 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6

**Andreas Lommel — *Masks: Their Meaning and Function***  
An anthropological survey of masks and their uses in various cultures. An anthropological survey of masks and their uses in various cultures. Excellent visual reference as well. Frames Veil as a reorganization (or subversion) of social relations, not just a parlor trick or disguise. The other big theme is that the mask defines the ceremony/ritual/situation – it is not merely cosmetic.

## Identity

**Wendy Hui Kyong Chun — *Control and Freedom***  
Control and Freedom wrestles with the paradox of technology: oppressor AND liberator. Chun examines how systems of control are often experienced as participation or freedom. This context sharpens the Veil’s engagement with misrecognition, discomfort and agency.

### **Further reading: Erving Goffmann – *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life***  

---

## Facial Recognition

**Kelly A. Gates — *Our Biometric Future***  
Probably the most important source for Veil. Gates describes how facial recognition moved from experimental research into routine institutional use… and its impact on society and the individual. Useful for understanding/framing the spectrum of this project (social, personal, policy, technology).

## Technology/Reference

**Stan Z. Li, Anil K. Jain, Jiankang Deng – *Handbook of Face Recognition***  
Considered to be “The” handbook on developing technology for facial recognition. Useful for reference or technical understanding.

**Aditya Gupta – *The IoT Hacker’s Handbook***

**Milette & Stroud *– Professional Android Sensor Programming***

***More tbd…***
