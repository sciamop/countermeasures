### Abstract

I propose a series of branded, crafted, DIY, OSS ***devices*** that can disrupt the hardware/software that *Big Tech* uses to ensorcel us through perpetual surveillance, data mining, behavioral modification, political influence, market dominance and so much more..

### Introduction

I have had a lifetime love affair with technology – Atari 2600 to AI. In the last decade, I’ve grown increasingly suspect of the companies behind the most popular commercial technologies.

*Can Big Tech be fought with Small Tech?*

My background in technology hasn’t just been as a consumer but also a maker. This project offers me the opportunity to combine my life/career experiences in software design with my amateur/artist interest in industrial design and engineering.

Some questions I am seeking the answers to:

  * Is it possible to develop personal DIY tech that thwarts the negative outcomes of Big Tech?
  * Can these devices gain notoriety and raise awareness/controversy about Big Tech?
  * Can it scale up to actually subvert the Big Tech business models?
  * \<\<more to come\>\>

### Research Questions / Objectives

#### Objective

Develop a range of real world, physical devices that combat toxicity of Big Tech on individuals and society. All designs will be released with a CC/OSS license.

These devices need to be effective, user-friendly, well-designed and durable. They will also mimic the industrial/UX design language of the tech company which they are subverting. For instance, an Amazon-thwarting device would feature the black, mesh, LED look of Alexa devices. Finally, they should have whimsy and utility – people should want to use them.

#### Questions

  * ~~What are people willing to carry?~~ Not relevant
  * What are the cultural taboos associated with wearing technology?
  * Is it possible to fuse fashion and technology?
  * Can these things be relatively autonomous?
  * How cheaply can they be made?
  * ~~What are the devices?~~ Meaty subject. Focus on Veil.
  * What are the concepts, themes, activities that are most creepy from Big Tech? How can they be rendered in reality?

### Project Description

#### Mediums, methods, and materials

This project aims to bring together all the mediums, methods and materials that I’ve learned in the last 4 years in the DDF Grad program as well as my work/life experience prior.

  * 3D printing
  * CNC
  * Laser cutting
  * Metalworking
  * Woodworking
  * Ceramics
  * Electronics
  * CAD/Parametric design
  * Virtual Reality
  * Software engineering
  * User Experience
  * LLM/Diffusion AI

#### Scale, scope, and form

The thesis consists of three parts: device, exhibition and documentary.

***Device***

The *Countermeasures* project aims to address the societal challenges raised by unregulated libertarian capitalist technology firms. Here are some conceptual directions for what the family of ‘products’ might address:

|     |                                                                                                           |
| :-: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     | **The Larry**Problem: Panopticon, behavioral modification, disinformation, surveillance technology vendor |
|     | **The Mark** Problem: Panopticon, behavioral modification, disinformation, surveillance technology vendor  |
|     | **The Elon** Problem: Behavioral modification, Disinformation, Surveillance technology vendor              |
|     | **The Jeff** Problem: Panopticon, surveillance technology vendor                                           |
|     | **The Satya** Problem: Panopticon, behavioral modification, surveillance technology vendor                 |
|     | **The Peter** Problem: Surveillance technology vendor                                                      |

Due to the complexity, depth and scope of the problems caused by these entities, the initial release of *Countermeasures* will consist of a single device:

**Veil (or Facetook)** - a head-mounted system that extracts and repurposes the faces of individuals within camera range. A front-mounted LCD screen will display an animated version of the captured face. Due to the LCD screen, the wearer’s vision will be mediated through a screen (similar to a VR headset).

This project is a direct response to the launch of privacy/identity-annihilating devices from Meta/Facebook (Meta Ray Ban), Google (knock-offs Meta Ray Ban) and Apple (Vision Pro).

In order for art to be meaningful beyond ornamentation/craft, it must provoke an emotional response from the viewer. Seeing one’s own face extracted, co-opted and repurposed – without permission or control – will elicit a strong response AND functions as a powerful material example of surveillance capitalism’s architecture.

***Exhibition***

Participants will be encouraged to pick up, use the veil and question their relationship with Big Tech. Each object will include context, framing, process and instructions.

***Documentary***

*Report or it didn’t happen* – Jeremy Mendel, UX Researcher  
As noted in the next section, I will be building a public, digital archive/presence to document my work. Ideally, this can be compiled into a visually rich, long-form thesis document.

### Significance

*Poets are the Unacknowledged Legislators of the World* – Shelley

Our world of 2025 is shaped by Big Tech… for better or, more recently, far worse. Ideas that are extremely critical of Big Tech, presented in the accoutrements of technology can act as a virus of the mind in viewers/users that will force them to ponder the mechanics of Big Tech on themselves and society.

### Resources

TBD. I have most of the equipment and materials necessary for completing this work. Mostly, I need feedback and support from staff and fellow grad students\! If any items are larger, I may need access to a 4x8 CNC machine but that can, most likely, be outsourced.

### Appendix

#### Process

This is a meaty subject that I’ve spent a decade pondering. Scoping it down into a handful of polished pieces will be tough. I will use a basic design thinking framework to provide structure and guardrails: Understand \> Define \> Diverge \> Decide \> Build. This is not a rigid process and some steps can happen in parallel – especially if there are several objects being developed.
