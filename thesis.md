## Abstract
*Pull from prospectus... but focus on intersection of surveillance, identity, wearables, technology and, of course, ddf. *

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation
Reaction to massive increases in surveillance state/capitalism. Tech as identity. Extraction imperative/Rendered behavior > commoditized self (zuboff). 

### 1.2 Personal context
Worked at Google for a decade and contributed to surveillance economy in display ads. Watched interest-based targeting degenerate into psychographics, behaviorial modification and meme warfare.

### 1.3 Research Questions
- What does it mean to design objects that resist, confuse, or refuse visibility?
- Can wearable technology function as a form of counter-power rather than compliance?
- How can speculative artifacts operate simultaneously as critique, tool, and provocation?
- Legislation, not protest art, is required. How does this move the needle?

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Surveillance Capitalism and Visibility

*Grounding theory.*  
Reference concepts such as data extraction, behavioral surplus, facial recognition, biometric systems, and platform power. Frame visibility as a coerced condition rather than a neutral one.

### 2.2 Power, Control, and the Body

Discuss the body as an interface: scanned, measured, predicted, and regulated. Connect historical forms of control to contemporary digital systems.

### 2.3 Design as Critical Practice

Position Veil within critical design, speculative design, and adversarial design traditions. Emphasize design not as problem-solving, but as question-generating.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Surveillance Capitalism and Visibility

Data extraction, behavioral surplus, facial recognition, biometric systems, and platform power... visibility as a coerced condition rather than a neutral or default setting. The right to disappear. The right to privacy. The right to be invisible. The right to confuse!


### 2.2 Power, Control, and the Body

The body as an interface: scanned, measured, predicted, and regulated. Connect historical forms of control to contemporary digital systems.

### 2.3 Design as Critical Practice

Veil/system within critical design, speculative design, and adversarial design traditions. Design not as problem-solving (or worse aesthetics), but as provocation and protest!

## 3. Precedents and Influences

### 3.1 Artistic and Design Precedents

This is a very rich area to mine. As such there are many artists, designers and activists working it: wearables, obfuscation, surveillance critique, and speculative technology.

### 3.2 Technological Precedents

AR/VR headsets, facial recognition systems, biometric sensors, and wearable computing as both inspiration and antagonists. Rise of drone warfare/connected battlefield/palantir?

### 3.3 Cultural and Fictional Influences

Science fiction, dystopian narratives, and cultural artifacts that inform the project’s aesthetic and conceptual language. Particularly the history of the mask from ritual to disguise to intimidation.                     

## 4. Project Overview: Veil

### 4.1 Conceptual Description

Define Veil as a modular, wearable system designed to disrupt facial recognition, invert visibility, and reassert agency over perception.

### 4.2 System Architecture

High-level breakdown of:
- External-facing displays
- Internal visibility systems
- Sensors, cameras, and compute
- Modular power and processing

### 4.3 Aesthetic Language

Material choices, form language, and visual references. Emphasize futurism, industrial design, etc

---

## 5. Process and Methodology

### 5.1 Research and Prototyping

Detail iterative development: sketching, CAD, parametric design, electronics testing, and fabrication.

### 5.2 Digital Fabrication

Explain the role of 3D printing, CNC (?), parametric modeling (?????), and material experimentation (fine metalwork, wood, etc).

### 5.3 Software and Systems

Outline software components: vision pipelines, display logic, AI/ML elements, and system integration.

## 6. Iterations and Artifacts

### 6.1 Early Experiments

Document failed or exploratory prototypes and what they revealed.

### 6.2 Final Prototype(s)

Describe the most complete realization of Veil, including functionality, limitations, and intended use scenarios.

### 6.3 Exhibition and Interaction

How the project is meant to be encountered: worn, observed, documented, or performed.

---

## 7. Evaluation and Reflection

### 7.1 Successes

What worked conceptually, technically, and materially.

### 7.2 Limitations

What remains unresolved: technical constraints, ethical tensions, usability/practicality issues.

### 7.3 Ethical Considerations

Address ambiguity: resistance vs escalation, privacy vs provocation, individual action within systemic problems, "for my friends everything, for my enemies the law".

---

## 8. Contribution and Implications

### 8.1 Contribution to Design Practice

How Veil expands conversations around wearable technology and cultural/critical interpretations.

### 8.2 Broader Implications

Future trajectories: counter-surveillance tools, personal autonomy, authoritarian regimes, re-imagine software as an app rather than OS for a helmet and the aesthetics of refusal.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Reiterate the project’s core argument: that design can operate as a countermeasure, not by offering solutions, but by exposing power, destabilizing norms, and making the invisible visible—selectively.
