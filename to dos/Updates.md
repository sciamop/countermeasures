**Problem**: How to build a mixed reality platform on the cheap. 

**Solution**: Scavange parts from a Meta Quest 2 headset (lenses and view screen)

**Approach**: Used Quest 2 headsets have crashed in value. Widely available for $30 - $40 on ebay in used/acceptable condition. 

**Challenge**: After disassembly, discovered that Quest 2 screen has proprietary connector. The only resuable parts are the mechanical viewport and fresnel lenses. 

**Commentary**: Quest 2 is just eWaste if you don't want to run Zuckerberg's spyware.

**Problem**: Wearer of the veil will have their face obscured by an outward facing screen  

**Solution**: Provide an MR-enabled immersive view on a high-refresh/hi-resolution screen  

**Approach**: Hi-res/hi-refresh screens are very expensive and may require specialized compute to run at peak performance. Turns out that I have an integrated high-quality screen/compute in my… pocket! Many low cost VR systems use a smartphone as CPU/Display, so why not for Veil?

**Challenge**: Significantly increases bulk on the front of the Veil (bad). Also its a mobile phone from Google which violates many of the precepts of the project (surviellance capitalism, platform, state surveillance tool, highly trackable).

**Commentary**: The Pixel 7 Pro is a good compromise for prototyping (Android has great development experience) but looking to switch to a screen-only hardware solution for launch. Pixel 7 Pro does have other advantages as well as it could provide most of the compute (except external display image) for the entire project as well.
