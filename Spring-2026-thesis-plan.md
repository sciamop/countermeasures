3. Mar 21, 2026: Prototype v2 integrated; thesis core chapters drafted.
4. Apr 11, 2026: Final build candidates frozen; thesis full draft complete.
5. Apr 25, 2026: Revisions done; exhibition assets ready; full run-through.
6. May 1, 2026: Exhibition.

## Weekly Cadence
1. Mon-Tue: Build and test mechanical bits.
2. Wed-Thu: Software iterations and integration.
3. Fri: Thesis writing and documentation.


## Detailed Timeline

### Feb 1–Mar 1: Prototype v1
1. Mechanical: build rough prototype; test form, fit, and basic function.
2. Software: build a functional prototype; test core interaction loop.
3. Thesis: draft intro + methods; create figures list.

### Mar 2–Mar 22: Prototype v2 + Integration
1. Mechanical: iterate on weaknesses from v1; stress test.
2. Software: implement interaction refinements; stabilize core.
3. Integration: first full system integration test.
4. Thesis: draft results/analysis sections from tests.

### Mar 23–Apr 12: Final Build
1. Mechanical: finalize materials, fabrication, and assembly.
2. Software: finalize features, stability, and build process.
3. Integration: full system validation.
4. Thesis: complete full draft.
5. Exhibition: Get rough draft of materials and confirm location etc

### Apr 13–Apr 30: Polish + Exhibition
1. Mechanical: finish aesthetic details and reliability checks.
2. Software: bug fixing and final performance pass.
3. Thesis: revision and formatting; advisor feedback if possible.
4. Exhibition: signage, documentation, rehearsal, packing checklist.

## Quick Check-Ins
1. Weekly (with Laura): Are we on track for the next milestone?
2. Biweekly (With Chad): Any blockers or scope cuts needed?
